        <h1>HELLO!</h1>
        <p>
          We are more than your normal coffee shop; we are a part of your
          everyday lives. Our passion and love of home-cooked meal is portrayed
          in every dish we serve.

        <p>
          Come and choose from our heartily and healthy all day brunch, sexy
          salads or good old fashioned specials with a taste of Persia. We have
          excellent coffee, speciality teas and an array of freshly pressed
          juices and smoothies. And last but by far not the least, we have
          freshly baked cakes which will put a smile on your face.

          <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
          <p>
            I started my first coffee shop in 2004 in Hampstead Garden Suburbs
            after deciding to give up my 9 to 5 job in the city. With no
            catering experience, the only way I knew how to operate a business
            was NOT to look at it as a business. I treated it like my home and
            all the customers were guests in my home.
